We need to create a proper project structure.

Always it will be in reverse order of company domain i.e. (com.infosys etc...)

Ex: Create a folder structure as 
	src/main/scala/com.infy.in.si/cli  (Arguments)
	src/main/scala/com.infy.in.si/common (Common Code/Re-usable)
	src/main/scala/com.infy.in.si/code (Actual Code)
	
	//ly 
	
	src/test/scala/
	

There will be a target folder structure which will have the jar that is generated.

	target/scala-2.11/

package will generate an individual jar for the main program.
assembly will create a single fat jar which includes all the dependencies.

We also have build.sbt in target folder which has details of all the jars that needs to be included.
We can know the verions of the jars compatible to scala version which we use from mvn repos.

ex: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.scopt/scopt_2.10/2.1.0

By-default when proj is created it will create build.properties with sbt version used

sbt.version = 0.13.15

Path:  /<Proj Name>/target/build.properties

plugins.sbt will include the sbt plugin details and the jars to exclude.

Path:  /<Proj Name>/target/plugins.sbt
